## 📝 Abstract

Automated fish identification is crucial for advancing intelligent aquaculture systems through enhanced stock monitoring and behavioral analysis. While current Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based methods demonstrate promising recognition capabilities, they often struggle with computational redundancy and limited adaptability to complex underwater environments.

In this study, we propose a novel network exploration methodology, grounded in the RegNet design paradigm, to develop task-specific architectures for underwater fish recognition. By training on a small dataset with approximately 200K iterations, we developed high-performing models, termed **SeekNet**, across varying complexities. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SeekNet demonstrates superior performance. On our primary dataset, SeekNet achieves a rank-1 accuracy of **95.97%** and a True Acceptance Rate (TAR) of **88.04%** at a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of $10^{-6}$.
